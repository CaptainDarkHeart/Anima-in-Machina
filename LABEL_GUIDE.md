## LABEL EVOLUTION AWARENESS

Labels evolve over time. Early Lucidflow (2004-2008) sounds different from current releases. Consider:
- **Golden Era**: When was the label at its creative peak?
- **Style Drift**: Has the label's sound changed significantly?
- **Roster Changes**: Key artists leaving/joining affects aesthetic
- **Market Pressures**: Some labels chase trends vs. maintain vision

### Recommended Exploration Approach
1. Start with label's current releases to understand present aesthetic
2. Work backwards through catalog chronologically
3. Identify "golden period" that resonates with your taste
4. Deep-dive that era for collection building
5. Stay current with new releases from labels you trust
