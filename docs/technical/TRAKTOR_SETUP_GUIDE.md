## CUE POINT SYSTEM

### Color Coding Strategy

#### BLUE - Load/Start Points
- **Load Cue**: First beatgrid downbeat (where track loads)
- **True Intro**: Actual track beginning (if different from load point)
- **Usage**: Quick loading, intro analysis

#### GREEN - Mix-In Opportunities
- **Primary Mix-In**: Safest entry point from typical previous track
- **Alternative Mix-In**: Different entry point for specific contexts
- **Early Mix-In**: For starting during previous track's long outro
- **Usage**: Multiple mixing options depending on context

#### YELLOW - Track Sections/Structure
- **Intro End**: Where intro elements complete, full track begins
- **First Drop**: Main arrangement/groove arrives
- **Breakdown Start**: Where energy reduces/elements drop out
- **Breakdown End**: Where energy returns
- **Usage**: Understanding track structure for planning

#### ORANGE - Loops & Extensions
- **Loop A**: Primary loop-worthy section (most hypnotic)
- **Loop B**: Alternative loop section
- **Loop C**: Third option if track has multiple loop opportunities
- **Usage**: Quick access to hypnotic extensions

#### RED - Mix-Out & Ending Points
- **Mix-Out Point**: When to start next track for smooth transition
- **Outro Start**: When track begins resolving
- **Track End**: Actual ending (for emergency knowledge)
- **Usage**: Timing transitions, planning ahead

#### PURPLE - Special/Creative
- **FX Sweet Spot**: Section that responds well to effects
- **Build Point**: Where energy increases significantly
- **Special Element**: Unique sound or moment worth highlighting
- **Usage**: Creative mixing opportunities

---

### Cue Point Naming Convention

**Format**: `[TYPE] - [DESCRIPTION] - [TIMING]`

**Examples**:
- `Mix-In - After Pad Entry - 2:30`
- `Loop A - Dub Chords 16bar - 4:00-5:00`
- `Mix-Out - Before Breakdown - 6:45`
- `FX - Reverb Sweet Spot - 5:20`

**Why This System:**
- Quick visual identification via color
- Text description for specifics
- Time reference for planning

---

### Standard Cue Point Set for Deep Space House

For most tracks, aim for **8-10 cue points** covering:

1. **Load Cue** (Blue): Beatgrid start
2. **Mix-In Point** (Green): Primary entry
3. **Alt Mix-In** (Green): Alternative entry if available
4. **Intro End** (Yellow): Full arrangement begins
5. **Loop A** (Orange): Best loop section
6. **Loop B** (Orange): Alternative loop if applicable
7. **Peak Section** (Yellow): Track's main energy zone
8. **Mix-Out Point** (Red): Start next track here
9. **Outro Start** (Red): Track begins resolving
10. **FX Point** (Purple): Special creative opportunity if exists

## LOOP MANAGEMENT

### Loop Settings
**Preferences â†’ Transport â†’ Loop Recorder**

- **Loop Size Defaults**: 4, 8, 16, 32 bars (deep house works with longer loops)
- **Auto Loop**: OFF (manual control preferred)
- **Loop Move Size**: 1 beat (fine adjustment)
- **Loop Quantize**: ON (keep loops on beatgrid)

### Loop Workflow for Live Mixing

1. **Identify Loop Section** (pre-marked with orange cue point)
2. **Set Loop Length** (usually 8 or 16 bars for deep house)
3. **Activate Loop** (on drop or appropriate phrase start)
4. **Monitor** (listen for listener fatigue, watch floor)
5. **Extend or Exit** (add 1-2 loops or move to mix-out)

### Loop Length Guidelines by Context

**4-Bar Loops**:
- Brief extensions only (30-60 seconds)
- Percussion-only sections
- Build-ups and transitions

**8-Bar Loops**:
- Standard deep house loop length
- Groove pockets (1-2 minutes)
- Breakdown sections

**16-Bar Loops**:
- Extended hypnotic sections (2-4 minutes)
- Dub techno chord loops
- Sustained pad sections
- When crowd is deep in trance

**32-Bar Loops**:
- Rare, only for extremely minimal sections
- Ambient/atmospheric sections
- Very advanced technique

## MIXER SETTINGS

### EQ Configuration
**Preferences â†’ Mixer â†’ EQ**

- **EQ Type**: Classic (smooth curve, musical)
- **EQ Range**: Â±12dB (sufficient for deep house, not extreme)
- **Filter Type**: Xone:92 (smooth, musical, gradual)
- **Filter Range**: Full (0-100%)

### EQ Mixing Strategy for Long Blends

**Typical 60-90 Second Blend**:

1. **Start (0-20 sec)**: 
   - Incoming track: Low and mid EQ at -6dB, high at -3dB
   - Just entering, establishing presence

2. **Early Blend (20-40 sec)**:
   - Incoming: Gradually raise high to 0dB (add brightness)
   - Outgoing: Begin gentle low reduction if bass will clash

3. **Mid Blend (40-60 sec)**:
   - Incoming: Raise mids to -3dB, lows still -6dB
   - Outgoing: Low at -6dB, considering mid reduction
   - Both tracks clearly present

4. **Late Blend (60-75 sec)**:
   - Incoming: Raise lows to 0dB (full frequency presence)
   - Outgoing: Progressive EQ reduction, becoming atmospheric layer

5. **Resolution (75-90 sec)**:
   - Incoming: Full EQ (0dB across spectrum)
   - Outgoing: Faded to ambient layer or out entirely

**Note**: Times are guidelines; adjust based on tracks and vibe.

## CROSSFADER CONFIGURATION

### Crossfader Curve
**Preferences â†’ Mixer â†’ Crossfader**

- **Curve Type**: Smooth/Logarithmic (gradual transition)
- **Curve Steepness**: ~40-60% (middle ground)
- **Usage**: Most deep space house mixing uses channel faders, not crossfader

### Channel Fader Strategy (Recommended)

**Why Channel Faders Over Crossfader for Deep Space House:**
- Allows both tracks at full volume simultaneously
- Better for long, atmospheric blends
- More natural for layering textures
- Easier to maintain balance during extended mixes

**Crossfader Usage Scenarios:**
- Emergency quick cuts (rare in deep space house)
- Creative effects (stutter/transform)
- Quick A/B comparison during preparation

- **Auto Master**: OFF (manual control preferred)
- **Tempo Range**: Â±8% (standard, sufficient for deep house)
- **Keylock**: ON by default (maintain pitch when adjusting tempo)

### Sync Strategy for Deep Space House

**When to Use Sync:**
- During long blends (frees hands for EQ/effects)
- When small BPM differences (0.5 BPM or less)
- In sustained layered sections

**When to Manual Beatmatch:**
- Large BPM changes (2+ BPM difference)
- When tracks have loose/organic timing
- For practice and skill maintenance
- When sync feels "wrong" (groove clash)

### BPM Transition Strategy

**Small Changes (0-1 BPM)**:
- Instant adjustment or gradual over 1-2 phrases
- Barely noticeable to dancers

**Medium Changes (1-2 BPM)**:
- Gradual over 8-16 bars
- During blend where both tracks playing
- Use filter/effects to mask if needed

**Large Changes (3+ BPM)**:
- During breakdown or minimal section
- Use dramatic filter sweep to mask
- Or use loop of neutral percussion as bridge
- Consider if jump is too large (use intermediary track)

## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### "Loops Sound Off-Beat"
**Cause**: Inaccurate beatgrid  
**Solution**: Re-analyze track, manually adjust beatgrid, verify downbeat

### "Effects Sound Muddy"
**Cause**: Too much reverb/delay feedback, frequency buildup  
**Solution**: Reduce feedback, add high-pass filter to effects, reduce mix %

### "Can't Hear Mix-In Track in Headphones"
**Cause**: Cue button not activated, routing issue  
**Solution**: Check cue button on deck, verify audio routing in preferences

### "Sync Drifts Over Time"
**Cause**: Tracks with tempo variations, inaccurate beatgrid  
**Solution**: Manual beatmatching, verify beatgrid, re-analyze if needed

### "Filters Sound Harsh"
**Cause**: Too much resonance, wrong filter type  
**Solution**: Reduce resonance, try different filter (Xone:92 vs. Ladder)
